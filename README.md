# AnomalyDetection
GitHub repository for the code that accompanies the master thesis project: 'Detecting univariate anomalies in multivariate web analytics time series'. Written in 2018 at Gradient for the completion of the Msc Data Science & Entrepreneurship.

## Abstract
In this study, anomaly detection on web metrics was performed using a recurrent autoencoder.
Previous research suggests a multivariate model could be beneficial for anomaly detection
performance. Therefore a multivariate detection algorithm is tested to see if it could indirectly
detect multiple univariate anomalies in the data. To make these anomalies more interpretable,
a sequential ensemble is used where the multivariate detector is combined with univariate
detectors to find the variable where the anomaly originated. A synthetic dataset is produced to
compare results of different configurations as the real dataset is unlabeled.

## Repository
This repository consists of 5 main elements:

**1. analysis**\
Here all the notebooks for the initial EDA as well as the measurements of performance can be found.

**2. data**\
This section contains all the data (both artificually generated and real) that was used for the project.

**3. pictures**\
Containing a sample visual result of the algorithm performing on (part of) the real test set.

**4. scripts**\
This folder contains the actual execution notebooks for the created solution and Twitters' package, as well as the data generation script.

**5. Master thesis**\
In the main folder, the final version of the master thesis itself can be found in PDF format.
